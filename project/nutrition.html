		<h1> What is Nutritional Value </h1>
          <p>Nutritional value, sometimes simply referred to as nutrition, refers to the content of essential nutrients in a food or beverage.

		<h1> Why is Healthy Nutrition important to a Pregnant Woman ?  </h1>
          <p>Healthy nutrition is critically important to pregnant women for several reasons. During pregnancy, a woman's body undergoes significant physiological changes to support the growth and development of the fetus.
		     Proper nutrition plays a vital role in ensuring the health and well-being of both the mother and the unborn child.  </p>

		<h1> Benefits Of Good Nutrition to Pregnant Women </h1>
          <p>Maintaining a healthy diet offers numerous advantages.
		     To give a few examples, eating nutritious food provides women with more lasting energy, boosts their immune system, and lowers the likelihood of illness.
		     For pregnant women, paying special attention to their diet is crucial because it impacts not only their well-being but also the health of their baby.
		     When pregnant women eat healthily, they decrease the risk of problems like anemia, low birth weight, and birth defects. 
		     Good nutrition can also alleviate uncomfortable pregnancy symptoms.</p>

		<h1>Caloric Balance </h1>
          <p>Pregnancy is an energy-demanding process. The body has increased energy requirements to support the growth of the placenta, the expansion of the mother's blood volume, and the development of the baby. 
		     If a pregnant woman does not consume enough calories, 
		     she may experience excessive fatigue and weakness.</p>
