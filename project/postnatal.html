		<h1> What is Postnatal Care ? </h1>
          <p>Postnatal Care is the care given to a woman and her baby after the baby is born. This special care lasts for about 6 weeks, starting right after the baby is born and continuing until most of the mother's body has returned to the way it was before she became pregnant. It's a time when the mother and baby need extra attention to ensure they both stay healthy.
